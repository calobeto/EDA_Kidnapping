# EDA_Kidnapping
Exploratory Data Analysis to missing people in Per√∫

## Task
Collect data from a web page of missing People and do some Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Summary
The project consist on two notebooks : WebScraping_Desaparecidos.ipynb that collects web data and export into a csv file and EDA_desaparecidos which cleans the data and do some data analysis. I chose to built them in Jupyter notebook using libraries like beautiful soup and regex to collect web data, pandas to do some data munging/ wrangling and seaborn to do some visualizations.

## Statistics
The plots arrived to the following conclusions : 
1. The web page was launched in 2016 so we no have real data on 2016, 2017 and 2018.
