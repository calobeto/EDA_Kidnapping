# EDA_Kidnapping
Exploratory Data Analysis to missing people in Per√∫

## Task
Collect data from a web page of missing People and do some Exploratory Data Analysis.

## Summary
The project consist on two notebooks : WebScraping_Desaparecidos.ipynb that collects web data and export into a csv file and EDA_desaparecidos which cleans the data and do some data analysis. I chose to built them in Jupyter notebook using libraries like beautiful soup and regex to collect web data, pandas to do some data munging/ wrangling and seaborn to do some visualizations.

## Statistics
The plots arrived to the following conclusions : 
1. The web page was launched in 2016 so the quantities of kidnapping are not real on 2016, 2017 and maybe 2018.
2. The age range most likely to be kidnapped is between 12 and 18 years old.
3. Women are three times more likely to be abducted.
4. Lima is the department with the most disappeared people in Peru. Junin follows although it has much less population than other departments in Peru.
